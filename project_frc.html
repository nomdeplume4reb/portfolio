							<p>In collaboration with 180 Degrees Consulting Helsinki, I worked with a team of four to come up with a strategy for the Finnish Refugee Council (FRC) to expand their student donor base.
								The first stage of the project entailed writing and conducting a survey of local students on their attitudes towards donating to NGOs.
								The survey was open between 27.03.2020 and 21.04.2020 and was targeted and distributed (nonrandomly) to students of Finnish universities.
								Respondents were entered into a lottery for a 50 EUR gift card to K-Group supermarkets.</p>
							<p>I was the project lead for designing survey questions and analyzing results in R.</p>
							<p>We looked at respondent demographics, institutions of study, fields of study, employment and income and their correlation with donor behaviors.
								To better understand donor behavior, we asked about respondents' attitudes toward donating, potential motivations, as well as their familiarity with the Finnish Refugee Council.
